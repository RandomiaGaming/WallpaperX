WallpaperX depends upon Chromium which must be located in ./chromium/chrome.exe for WallpaperX to function.
To download Chromium for use in your own builds I recommend either:
Compiling and building Chromium manually if you need full control,
or downloading Chromium from https://github.com/Hibbiki/chromium-win64.
If downloading from GitHub I recommend the latest chrome.sync.7z version.
